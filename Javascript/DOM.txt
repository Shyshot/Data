 DOM document object model
    DOM is used for dyanmical change or manipulation of html or css file through javascript commands.

    DOM manipulation:-

    selecting ELements:
        selecting by id:
            document.getElementById("myid");
        selecting ELement by class name:
            document.getElementsByClassName("myClass");
        selecting ELement by tags:
            document.getElementsByTagName("tag");
    
        query selectors:
            document.querySelector("myid/myClass/tag")-->this attribute automatcially detects the type of ELement.
             it returns the first element of the respective id class or tag. Class if mentioned in query selector should always begin with a (.) 
             Id if mentioned in query selector should always begin with a (#  ) 
            
            document.querySelectorAll("myid/myClass/tag")-->
             it  returns a node list respective to the id class or tag

    Properties of DOM manipulation

        tagName -->Returns the name of tag to the coressponding tag
        innerText-->returns the text content of  the element and its children on the basis of hireachy of DOM
        innerHtml-->returns the text along with the  html tags in the element
        textContent-->returns the text along with the hidden ELements
    
    Attribute in DOM manipulation
    
        getAttribute(attr)//to get the value of the desired attribute
        Example:-
        setAttribute(attr,val)//to change the value of  attribute from existing  to val
        Example

        for style
         Style of the node ca be accessed using the syntax
         node.style
         style of the node can also be modifided by the using the syntax
         node.style.requiredStylechange="change";
         Example:

        insert ELement
        It is two step process 1.create the element 2. add element
        step 1 Create the element:-
        let newEl=document.createElement("requiredElement");
        step 2 Add element:-
        Add a element can be done through various different tags

        1.node.append(newEl)//adds at the end of the node(inside)
        2.node.prepend(newEl)//adds at the start of the node(inside)
        3.node.before(newEL)//add before the node(outside)
        4.node.after(newEl)//add after the node(outside)
        Example:-
        

        delete element:-
        node.remove() Remove the node

Events:-
The change in state of an object is known as an Events
Event is fired to notify code of a interesting changes that may affect code execution
Example of event:-
 mouse(click,double click,hover,etc)
 keyboard(keypress,keyup,keydown)
 form event(submit,focus etc.)
 print event

Basic Example

This is the example of inline event handling, which not considered to be a good practice as coders due to bulky and unreadable code


Event handling in javascript
 node.event()=>{
     //handle here
 }
       
Event Listener
node.addEventListener(event,callBack);
node.removeEventListener(event,callBack);
